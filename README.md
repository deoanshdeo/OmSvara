# OmSvara
## Overview
OmSvara is an upcoming music player designed specifically for Linux users who want a simple, lightweight, and efficient way to enjoy music while working or relaxing. The goal is to create a seamless audio experience that integrates well with various Linux distributions, addressing the need for a reliable and user-friendly music player.

## Motivation
As a Linux user, I often found existing music players either too heavy or keep crashing. OmSvara aims to fill this gap by offering a clean interface, smooth performance, and compatibility across most Linux systems.

## Current Status
This project is in the early planning stages. Development has not yet started, but the vision is to build a music player that prioritizes:
- Lightweight performance
- Support for common audio formats (e.g., MP3, FLAC, WAV)
- A distraction-free interface
- Easy installation across popular Linux distributions

## Planned Features
- Basic playback controls (play, pause, skip, shuffle, repeat)
- Playlist management
- Minimal system resource usage
- Customizable themes (optional)
- Cross-distribution compatibility (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.)

## Technologies (Tentative)

The tech stack is still under consideration, but possible options include:
- Programming Language: Python or C++ for performance
- GUI Framework: GTK, Qt, or lightweight alternative
- Audio Backend: GStreamer, VLC, or similar libraries

## Installation
(To be added once development begins)
